    "## Rubric Points\n",

    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",

    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the Nvidia End-to-End model Architecture, which is specifically designed to minimize the mean-squared error between the steering command and command of the human drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture is as follows, which consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers. \n",
    "![](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cnn-architecture-624x890.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road. I have also tried to drive the car in the opposite direction. Furthermore, I drived the car for two laps insted of just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to first use a suggested model architecture and then,if necessary, modified it.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the \"Nvdia end-to-end architecture.\" I thought this model might be appropriate because Nvidia architecture is specified designed for this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training(80%) and validation set(20%).\n",
    "I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model by adding a dropout layer. Then I tuning the dropout prob. First I used dropout(0.5), but the loss value is larger than before. So finally I change it to 0.25, it looks better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. At the very begging, the spots appera usually at the sharp curves and stone road. In order to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collect more data in these spots. I first drive the vehical along the curves and then reutrn to the middle of road. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "![](writeup_images/model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "![_auto_3](attachment:_auto_3)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Etc ....\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary."
